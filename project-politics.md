# Final Project
### What demographic factors are significant in explaining the results of the 2012 and 2016 US Presidential Elections at a county level?

Explaining the results of the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election is beneficial to 
understanding the way demographic and geographic factors impacted the result. Our 
model combines multinomial and logistic regression models with a spatial error and 
lag term. We found multiple demographic factors impacted the proportion of Trump voters 
in a county, such as the proportion of Romney voters in 2012 and the proportion of individuals 
with less than a Bachelorâ€™s degree, as well as significant spatial autocorrelation. This model 
is helpful in better understanding the significant factors of U.S. elections and can be adjusted 
to possibly predict upcoming elections.
